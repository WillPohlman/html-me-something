                   I'm a big fan of the St. Louis Blues. Last year I went to two Blues games. The first one was with two of my highschool friends. The game was on January 10th. At the time the Blues were near the bottom of the standings. The game was Jordan Binnington's first home start and the third game of what would be the Blues record 11 straight wins.

                       The second game was actually the watch party for game 5 at the Enterprise Center. My girlfriend won a raffle for tickets to her company's box. The crowd participated just as much as if the game was happening right there. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget.
