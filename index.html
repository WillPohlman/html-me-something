                   I'm a big fan of the St. Louis Blues. Last year I went to two Blues games. The first one was with two of my high school friends. The game was on January 10th and we had excellent seats in the 3rd row behind the Blues bench. At the time the Blues were near the bottom of the standings and our expectations were not very high. Fortunately the Blues won handily, 4-1, in an exciting game. It was Jordan Binnington's first home start and the third game of what would be the Blues record 11 straight wins.

                       The second game was actually the watch party for game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final at the Enterprise Center. My girlfriend won a raffle for tickets to her company's box. The crowd participated just as much as if the game was happening right there. As a Blues fan I was afraid they would be knocked out in round 1 or 2, but after the Dallas series I believed that we were going all the way. The Blues won in a nail-biter, 2-1. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget.
